## Overview

### The challenge

- Create a website where you can publish a lost pet report with different data about the pet and its geographic location. For this we will use a front/back architecture, where the back will be exposed to an API that will use Postgre as a database. Use this **[design](https://www.figma.com/file/jlBz7p7s1a2NyKUmwIY1jT/dwf-m7-desaf%C3%ADo?node-id=0%3A1)** as a reference.

- Have a documented API with Postman and with the link to the documentation in the Readme.md. **[API documentation](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/17951846/UVsEV965)**.

- Upload the application to Heroku and add the link in the Readme.md. **[Link Webapp](https://dwf-m7-looking-for-my-friend.herokuapp.com/)**

  - JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed. JWTs can be signed using a secret (with the HMAC algorithm) or a public/private key pair using RSA or ECDSA.
